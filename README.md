# Spaceship Titanic Kaggle

Data science project for [Spaceship Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) on Kaggle. 

# What was done?

1. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the data and any underlying trends. 
2. Preprocessed data such that it could be used to train machine learning models. This included breaking up columns, removing blank rows, label encoding categorical variables. 
3. Developed three models with the objective of determine which would yield the best predictions on preprocessed data.
4. Predicted on hidden test set and saved prediction in CSV.
5. Submitted prediction to Kaggle competition to receive accuracy score.

  Models developed and their respective prediction accuracy on the hidden test set:
  * Naive Bayes - 71.358%
  * SVM - 79.775%
  * Logistic Regression - 78.045%
